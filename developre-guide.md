# 🧭 JibonDaak — Developer Guide

Welcome to the **JibonDaak** project!  
This guide is for **team members** so everyone can code without breaking the main branch 😅  

---

## 👑 Project Maintainer
**Main Owner:** @Supto  
👉 Only Supto can merge to the `main` branch.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Clone the Repository

First, open your terminal or VS Code terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/JibonDaak.git
Then move into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd JibonDaak
🔄 2. Update to Latest Code Before Working
Always pull the latest main branch before starting work:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git pull origin main
🌿 3. Create Your Own Branch
Never work on the main branch directly.
Create a new branch for your feature or fix.

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature-<your-feature-name>
🧩 Examples
feature-login-page

fix-api-bug

update-readme

🧠 4. Start Developing
Now make your changes — add or edit files in VS Code.
Once done, save your work and commit your changes.

💾 5. Add and Commit Changes
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Added login page design"
✅ Use short and clear commit messages.
❌ Don’t use random stuff like “update” or “final code”.

🚀 6. Push Your Branch to GitHub
bash
Copy code
git push origin <your-branch-name>
Example:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature-login-page
If Git shows an error saying the branch doesn’t exist remotely, use:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
🧾 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)
After pushing, go to the GitHub website:

Click on the Pull Requests tab.

Click “New Pull Request”.

Set:

Base branch: main

Compare branch: your feature branch

Add a short title (example: “Added login page UI”)

Assign @SAHARIAR as reviewer.

Click Create Pull Request.

Now just wait for Supto to review and merge it. ✅

🚫 8. Important Rules
❗ Rule	Description
1	Never push directly to main
2	Always branch from the latest main
3	One feature per branch
4	Use clear commit messages
5	Supto merges PRs — don’t do it yourself

⚡ Example Full Workflow
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/JibonDaak.git
cd JibonDaak
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature-user-auth
# --- work on files ---
git add .
git commit -m "Added login and signup UI"
git push origin feature-user-auth
# then create PR on GitHub
🧩 Need Help?
If anything breaks or you’re confused, just ask Supto before pushing.
Better safe than sorry 😎

You want me to tailor it with **your real GitHub repo link** (so they can just copy–paste commands directly)?  
If yes, drop me your repo URL and I’ll plug it in cleanly.
